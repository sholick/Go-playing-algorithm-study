# Go-playing-algorithm-study

A research project started for the Advanced Algorithm course in 2020.
In the literature review, various go playing algorithms were studied, including the game's complexity and existing research conducted by researchers in the past.

In the experiment part, a simplified game of Go was programmed, and agents using strategies like minimax tree search, iterative deepening search and Monte-Carlo approaches were coded and played against each other. The brief results were recorded and analysed. Due to limitations in time and space, various ceilings have to be respected in these algorithms.
